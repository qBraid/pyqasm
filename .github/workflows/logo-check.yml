          Changes to \`docs/_static/logo.png\` are not allowed in pull requests.

          **Why is this blocked?**
          - The logo is a protected asset that should only be updated by repository maintainers
          - This helps maintain brand consistency and prevents unauthorized logo changes

          **What should you do?**
          - Remove the logo.png changes from this PR
          - If you need to update the logo, please contact the repository maintainers directly

          **Files changed in this PR:**
          \`\`\`
          ${process.env.INPUT_CHANGED_FILES || 'Unable to retrieve changed files'}
          \`\`\``
