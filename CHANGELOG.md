## Unreleased

### Improved / Modified

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed
- Fixed a nested external custom gate counting the depth of the decomposition it skipped, the shape the [#352](https://github.com/qBraid/pyqasm/issues/352) fix did not reach: `unroll(external_gates=["outer"])` on a gate whose body calls another custom gate emitted one statement but reported `depth() == 13`. The suppression flag was assigned and cleared without save-restore, so the inner gate clobbered the outer gate's state in both directions. It is now saved and restored, and the depth is recorded once, from the outermost external gate. ([#367](https://github.com/qBraid/pyqasm/issues/367))
